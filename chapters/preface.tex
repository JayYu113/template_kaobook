Physics is a science that fundamentally relies on measurement and modeling. The physicist's toolkit must therefore include the tools and methods that enable them to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item extract rational information from their measurements;
    \item approximate the behavior of a model system using mathematical analysis.
\end{enumerate}
This is why the course is divided into two parts: one focusing on measurement and another on mathematical concepts useful to physicists.

This course is aimed at a relatively broad audience, as it covers various tools used both in high school and higher education.
